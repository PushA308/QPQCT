Desc,Q1,A),What are the reasons for the popularity & success of Unix/Linux O.S.,2,CO1,Module1
Prog,Q1,B),"Give the basic function following system call and enlist their two uses of each.
1.vfork, 2. Signal 3. Kill 5. Exit.",4,CO3,Module1
Drg,Q2,A),Draw and elaborate the blocks of file system layout. Which block helps to find maximum numbers files/directory user can create? Which block gives information about state of file system? ,4,CO1,Module2
Prog,Q2,B),"Enlist the five scenarios of getblk algorithm, which scenarios are suffered from race condition? Why?",4,CO2,Module2
An-S,Q3,,"Write in short: (2*4=8) (any four)
a)Justify, why various fields of U area required to access during the process execution only.
b)In the algorithm getblk, if kernel removes a buffer from free list, it must raise the process priority level to block out interrupts before checking free list. Why?
c)Why there is per user or per process file descriptor table?
d)Kernel is non preemptive does it means mutual exclusive is there on kernel, if yes/no justify.
e)Why there is lock on inode, when there is read or write system calls on a inode but not while opening or creating a file?
f)Why free list of buffer in buffer cache is implemented like LRU, if it is implemented like MFU, what will happen?
g)The algorithms iget and iput do not require the processor execution level to be raised to block out the interrupts? What does this implies?",8,CO2,Mixed
Des,Q4,A),"For the following sequence system call, draw the files data structure entries.(per process FDT, File table and inode table) 
Process A 
fd1=open(“etc/password”, R); fd2= dup(fd1); fd3 = open(“etc/password”, W); 
fd4= create(“hari.c”, W); fd5=open(“etc/password”, R);
Process B
fd1=open(“etc/password”, R); fd2= dup(fd1); fd3 = open(“private”, W);
fd4=open(“etc/password”, R);
Then again draw the data structure entries for following:
Process A:Close (fd1);Close (fd3);
Process B:Close (fd2);Close (fd3); ",4,CO3,Module3
An-M,Q4,B),", double indirect and triple indirect blocks are required for file size of 3,50,000 Bytes. (Consider system V, 1 logical block = 1K bytes, Block number address: a 32 bit (4byte) integer) What is maximum size of file a file system support? What is maximum number of files a file system can contain?",4,CO3,Module3
